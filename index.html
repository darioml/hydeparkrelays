<h3>Hyde Park Relays Remembered (By Jennie Cox)</h3>

<p>The question of exactly which of three Imperial College students, Tony Watts, Robert (Bob) Gigg and Gordon Brown first thought of organising a relay race in nearby Hyde Park remains a subject of debate to this day. Nevertheless, between them and with the help of other cross-country club members, the idea grew into reality. Six London teams plus Reading, Southampton, Birmingham Universities and Northampton Engineering College were invited to Hyde Park for 2:30pm on Saturday 19th March, 1949. </p>

<p>While those first teams ran 6 laps of a 2 mile and 1312 yard course, skirting round the edge of the park, the organisers couldn’t possibly have predicted that they had started a race which would gradually grow in popularity such that it would attract teams from all around Great Britain and from many European countries. It was perhaps fitting that Imperial College won that first event; their team consisted of David Stead, J.J. Billups, Jimmy Sadler, R. W. Freeman, Tony Watts and Bob Gigg, who also ran the fastest lap of the day (13:58). </p>
