        For the first time since 1976 an overseas team won the men's race with Belgium's 
	Leuven University defeating varsity champions Cambridge University, <i>Pete Mulholland</i>
	reports.<br>
	Another major change was the necessity - due to construction of the Diana Walkway - of changing 
	a course that had been used for the past 39 years.
	The opening stage saw 5 of the 6 fastest times set as the leading group huddled against the winds 
	of the park. Angus McLean was first to break as he put Southampton University in pole position, 
	just clear of Belgium wouter Debrabandere. Cambridge, courtesy of Phil Tedd were third.<br>
	It looked all over as Dan Leggate and Simon O'Brien proceeded to haul Cambridge into a clear 44 second 
	lead over the Belgians by the halfway stage with the rest of the opposition trailing way behind.<br>
	Stage four saw the start of a comeback by the Belgian team and at the final changeover they had converted
	this into a lead of 17 seconds and then proceeded to pull even further away on stage six.<br>
	<p>
	The women's race saw current varsity champions Oxford University reversing the roles as they defeated Leuven University.
	After a moderate start by Oxford Ellen O'Hare, with the 3rd fastest time of the day, took them into second behing 
	Lucy martin of Manchester Past who had led off with A Buckley running a fst 11:31. The Belgian 
	team at this halfway stage were 3rd.<br>
	the 3rd stage saw Belgium's Anke Onsia pass Oxford's Caroline Miller to take the lead, but a final stage by American Kelley 
	Wilder saw her regain the initiative as she came home almost 200m clear. On the final stage Surrey cross country champion
	Zara Hyde-Peters got the Manchester team
	back into the medals at her stint of 11:22 gave her the fastest time of the day.<br>
