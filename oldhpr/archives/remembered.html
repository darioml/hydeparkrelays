        Imperial College students, Tony Watts, Robert (Bob) Gigg
        and Gordon Brown first thought of organising a relay race
        in nearby Hyde Park remains a subject of debate to this
        day. Nevertheless, between them and with the help of
        other cross-country club members, the idea grew into
        reality. Six London teams plus Reading, Southampton,
        Birmingham Universities and Northampton Engineering
        College were invited to Hyde Park for 2:30pm on Saturday
        19th March, 1949. While those first teams ran 6 laps of a
        2 mile and 1312 yard course, skirting round the edge of
        the park, the organisers couldn&#8217;t possibly have
        predicted that they had started a race which would
        gradually grow in popularity such that it would attract
        teams from all around Great Britain and from many
        European countries. It was perhaps fitting that Imperial
        College won that first event; their team consisted of
        David Stead, J.J. Billups, Jimmy Sadler, R. W. Freeman,
        Tony Watts and Bob Gigg, who also ran the fastest lap of
        the day (13:58).</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/oldcourse.gif" height="189" width="300"></p>
        <p><font size="4">1950</font> brought more than double
        the number of competing teams and also a very tight
        finish where Mike Barrett, running for Battersea, just
        managed to hold off Kings College.</p>
        <p><font size="4">By</font> the time of the third relay
        on a &#8216;cold, blustering&#8217; March day in 1951,
        there were 22 teams, all male, taking part. King&#8217;s
        College, London, won that particular race but now there
        were more teams from further afield. The first of many
        international athletes, John Disley an Olympic
        Steeplechase medallist, made an appearance for
        Loughborough setting a new course record. The first time
        that the Sir Roderic Hill cup left London was in 1954
        when Manchester University took the title. That same
        year, a guest team not competing for the trophy, set a
        course record of an incredible 81:03, admittedly they did
        have the Australian Olympic 1500m finalist D. Macmillan
        and John Disley to help them round.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Persistent</font> snow put the 1955
        race in jeopardy but a last minute thaw allowed
        Loughborough to win the race for the first time and J.
        Knopf of Selwyn College, Cambridge, to set a course
        record. </p>
        <p><font size="4">The</font> 10th Hyde Park Relay in 1958
        was celebrated with course records set in both team and
        individual events; Liverpool University shattered the
        existing record by 51 seconds (81:37) dragging Imperial,
        Southampton and Loughborough to also break the previous
        time. Martyn Hyman of Southampton ran 12:39, slicing 16
        seconds off the old record.</p>
        <p><font size="4">A</font> new trophy was introduced in
        1959, the Imperial College Union Cup, which was awarded
        to the fastest team from a college with less than 500
        male students.</p>
        <p><font size="4">In</font> 1961, on the insistence of
        the Royal Parks Police who predicted problems with ever
        increasing numbers of cars and of athletes charging along
        the roadside over the Serpentine Bridge, the old course
        had to be re-routed. The new course was longer (2 miles,
        1740 yards) and followed the banks of the Serpentine,
        thus entering Kensington Gardens for the first time. This
        was, according to &#8216;Felix&#8217;, Imperial
        College&#8217;s Student newspaper, "one of the most
        exciting races. IC in the form of J. Collins took a five
        second lead at the end of the fourth lap and J. Cleator,
        running next, put up the third fastest time of the day
        and increased the gap to 30 seconds". Unfortunately
        for Imperial, Ron Hill (running for Manchester) and D. M.
        Turner (Queen&#8217;s College, Cambridge) ran the fastest
        two times of the day and overtook G. Wenk of IC, pushing
        them into 3rd place. D. M. Turner, an international, went
        on to run the fastest lap a total of six times, making
        him the most successful individual in the Hyde Park
        Relay&#8217;s history.</p>
        <p><font size="4">After</font> the close finish of the
        previous year, Imperial College won the 14th Hyde Park
        Relay setting a new course record in the process (88:31,
        2miles &amp; 1740 yards). 1962 was also the year in which
        Herb Elliot graced the event with his presence, running
        the fourth fastest time of the day. In 1963, Manchester
        achieved their third win in five years.</p>
        <p><font size="4">A</font> touch of inspiration and,
        perhaps, an indication of the advances in and growing
        accessibility of transportation were the invitation of
        several European Universities in 1966. In 1967 there were
        seven European teams from a total of eighty-eight and
        there have been contingents from, for example, Holland,
        Germany, France, Poland, Spain and Belgium ever since.</p>
        <p><font size="4">The</font> winning teams from 1949 to
        1968 were awarded the &#8216;Sir Roderic Hill Cup&#8217;
        which was donated to the event by Air Chief Marshall Sir
        Roderic Hill, who was the Rector of Imperial College at
        the time of the first event. As stated on the cover of
        the original programme, it was meant to be a perpetual
        cup in that it would always be returned the following
        year to be awarded to the new winners. Unfortunately, in
        1968 Edinburgh University made the claim that after
        having won the race for three consecutive years they had
        won the cup outright and refused to return it. Now,
        thirty years later, the solid silver cup is due to be
        returned in time for the 50th event. </p>

        <em>First Hyde Park Relay, March 1949.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="4">A</font> minor last minute
        organisational trauma is customary for most Hyde Park
        Relays. However, 1974 was particularly memorable in that
        the officials did not arrive on time; the loan of a
        stopwatch from Cologne University meant that the race
        could finally be started! Jim Brown of Brunel (WLIoHE) set a fastest lap of 13:21. Another new trophy
        was introduced that year, the &#8216;Steve Webb
        Trophy&#8217; for the second placed team. </p>
        <p><font size="4">1976</font> was the first time that the
        winner&#8217;s trophy (at this time the Lady Roderic Hill
        Cup) left the British Isles with Cologne becoming the
        first European team to win the event by beating
        Loughborough into second place. One of the more famous
        athletes to have taken part, David Moorcroft, ran the
        fastest lap to equal the course record of 13:21.
        Allegedly, this was the year that some of the University
        of Belgium team were apprehended by police for trying to
        rock a car in Queen&#8217;s Gate; they managed to escape
        further detention by claiming not to speak English.
        Loughborough avenged their defeat of the previous year by
        winning in 1977, an event which was to be repeated a
        further twelve times in the following twenty years.</p>
        <p><font size="4">Another</font> big name features in the
        result list of 1978, that of Sebastian Coe running the
        fastest lap of the day (13:24) while in 1980, marathon
        expert Hugh Jones set the current lap record of 13:12. </p>
        <p><font size="4">A</font> lack of demand in earlier
        years was the likely reason for there not being a ladies
        race. However, in response to the rapid growth of the
        women&#8217;s running scene, 1980 brought the first
        women&#8217;s race, where there were three teams of six
        and two of four all running the men&#8217;s course. Four
        of the teams were European and the other was from London
        University. Due to the interest generated, the next year
        saw ladies&#8217; teams (still of six athletes) running a
        shorter course, which followed the bank of the
        Serpentine. Although popular, many teams could not field
        six women and the 1982 event had teams of four running
        the shorter course, an arrangement which has become the
        tradition. </p>
        <p><font size="4">The</font> 1986 event was remarkable in
        that it was the fastest women&#8217;s race so far; the
        first three teams occupy four of the fastest times on the
        all-time list while the first five individuals ran 11:19
        or faster, a time that has rarely been bettered.</p>
        <p><font size="4">By</font> the time of the 40th Hyde
        Park Relay in 1988 there were 142 men&#8217;s teams and 52
        women&#8217;s teams on the entry list, numbering well over
        1000 competitors. </p>
        <p><font size="4">A</font> big upset occurred in 1990
        when the three leading ladies on the first leg all went
        off course and finished in remarkable times of about 7
        minutes! The strong teams of Liverpool Old Girls,
        Loughborough and Glasgow were subsequently disqualified.
        The fastest time run by a men&#8217;s team was set in 1991
        by Loughborough, who ran a very impressive 83:21. That
        year Simon Mugglestone, of Oxford, ran the fastest lap
        for the third consecutive year with the joint second
        fastest of all time (13:17). There has only been one
        other individual who has run the fastest lap three
        consecutive times and that is Mara Myers, also of Oxford,
        from 1994-1996. </p>
        <p><font size="4">Recent</font> Hyde Park history has
        been rather taken up with the problems of route changes.
        Generally the course has appeared to become slower,
        allegedly due to the laying down of gravel on many paths,
        an attempt to halt rollerbladers in certain areas. Due to
        new building work and path repair, the usual route round
        the Serpentine had to be forsaken in 1996.
	 Times from that year, therefore,
        appear slower especially for the women who ran
        considerably further than usual. 1997 saw a return to the
        traditional course though there were a few problems on
        the first lap when poor marshalling meant that all the
        first leg men went slightly awry; none was disqualified. </p>
