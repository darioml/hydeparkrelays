<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>Unfortunately due to circumstances outside of our control we are no longer able to provide accommodation in Imperial College Union before or after the race. Sincere apologies to all who have already expressed interest in accommodation. </p>

<p>Although it is no longer possible to use Imperial College facilities for accommodation, we are looking for any feasible alternatives; however we cannot expect or promise anything for certain. </p>
