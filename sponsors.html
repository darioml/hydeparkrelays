		<h2>Illuminate Agency</h2>
		<p class=""><img src="sponsor_one.jpg" style="max-width: 70%; width: 200px"></p>
		<p>Digital has totally changed the marketing landscape. We’ve moved from planning and booking media at the start of the year, to real time adaptive plans. Even digital itself has had its own revolutions, from premium to programmatic. Everything is changing, so you need to work with an agency that can adapt.</p>
		<p>We don’t silo channels and make them fight for budget. We unify them, creating and offsetting value between them. We review how your marketing is working as a whole.</p>
		<p>We’ve taken creative under our wing too, producing great pieces of native content or video ads that deliver first-rate brand awareness but also are routed in performance.</p>
